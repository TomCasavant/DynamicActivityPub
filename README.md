# DynamicActivityPub

## DISCLAIMER: DO NOT USE THIS CODE THIS WAS FOR TESTING PURPOSES ONLY, I STORE PRIVATE KEYS UNENCRYPTED KEYS IN THE DATABASE AND WEB ENDPOINTS ARE NOT PROTECTED BY ANY SORT OF AUTHENTICATION

Messing around with ActivityPub, needed a way to generate activitypub profiles/messages dynamically (they do not need authentication because none of them are real users), primarily used to test this minetest activitypub bridge https://github.com/TomCasavant/MinetestActivityPub/
